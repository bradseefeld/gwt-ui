This project is intended to create production ready UI components on the GWT 
framework. It aims to use no dependencies other than the GWT itself and to be
as fast as possible. It also aims to follow the GWT architecture as closely
as possible. For example, using tools provided such as UIBinder, ClientBundle, etc.

Goals:

* Speed. As fast as possible!
* Download size. Few dependencies. Few/none external resources such as images/css.
* Follow the GWT design (UiBinder, ClientBundle, i18n, etc)
